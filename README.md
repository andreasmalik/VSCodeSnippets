# VSCodeSnippets

Useful JavaScript-Snippets for Visual Studio Code. I was inspired by the Extension "JavaScript (ES6) code snippets" 
by "charalampos karypidis". You can download the original extension at the marketplace at 
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets. 

I added some additional snippets for my personal tasks and styles. Hopefully you like it!


# Snippets

* Import
* Export 
* Classes / Methods / Properties
* Loops
* Functions
* Console
* Misc


# Installation

Copy the javascript.json file to "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets" or open VSCode and select 
"Code"->"Preferences"->"User Snippets" and paste the content of the javascript.json file in it.

Don't forget to restart VSCode!

Done.


# Todo

I will extend the snippets for some features:

* JSDoc-Comments
